        <b>Speed Cubing</b> - Solve a variety of combinational puzzles racing
        against time. Observe, Orient, decide and act in a second.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Materials: Bring your own cube to the virtual sessions.</b>
      </p>
      <p>All cube sizes have 3 levels.</p>
      <p>
        Beginner - This is a foundational course to learn the basics of cubing
        such as cubing notations and its algorithms. If you are new to cubing
        and like to learn algorithms, then this is where you start.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intermediate - This is an intermediate level course to perfect your
        algorithms. If you know your algorithms, however your average speed is
        in between 60 - 30 secs, this is your stop for speed optimization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced - This is an advanced level course where you are ready to
        participate in competitions and are looking for healthy competitors to
        perfect your skill. Your average speed varies between 30 - 6 secs.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are new to cubing, we recommend the following order - 3x3, 2x2,
        Pyraminx
