        I started the endeavor of Speedcubing just over a year ago in March of
        2022, when I got my first 3x3. Determined to learn how to solve this
        puzzle, I spent some time in my room trying to figure out how to figure
        this out, and with the help of Youtube I finally learnt. My father
        promised me that if I could consistently solve a Rubik’s Cube in under
        30 seconds I could go to a Cubing Competition in West Virginia. I
        managed to do so, in about two months, and at that competition I got a
        Personal Record of 27.49. Since then I’ve been constantly improving, and
        now have a Personal record of 10.49 seconds in competition. I can solve
        many different cubes, from 2x2 to 7x7, and a variety of other puzzles
        like Pyraminx, Skewb, Square-1, and Megaminx.
