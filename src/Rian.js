        Just over a year ago, in March of 2022, I embarked on the exciting
        journey of Speedcubing. It all started when I received my very first 3x3
        Rubik's Cube. Fueled by determination, I dedicated countless hours in my
        room, tirelessly trying to unravel the secrets of solving this
        captivating puzzle. Thanks to the invaluable guidance of YouTube
        tutorials, I eventually mastered the techniques. Motivated by my
        progress, my father made me a promise: if I could consistently solve the
        Rubik's Cube in under 30 seconds, I would have the opportunity to
        participate in a Cubing Competition in West Virginia. With unwavering
        perseverance, I achieved this milestone in just two months. It was at
        that very competition where I achieved a personal record time of 27.49
        seconds. Since then, my journey as a Speedcuber has been marked by
        continuous improvement. Through relentless practice and dedication, I
        have honed my skills and now boast a personal record of an impressive
        10.49 seconds in competition. Not only can I solve various cubes ranging
        from 2x2 to 7x7, but I have also delved into a multitude of other
        intriguing puzzles such as Pyraminx, Skewb, Square-1, and Megaminx. The
        world of Speedcubing has become my passion, and I eagerly anticipate the
        challenges and triumphs that lie ahead on this thrilling path of cubing
        excellence.
