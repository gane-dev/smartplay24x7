        Speed is my favorite word. I started cubing in March 2022, when my mom
        gifted us the first 3X3. Being the curious George myself, I locked
        myself in a room in an attempt to solve it. It took me 4 straight hrs to
        mimic a youtube video. I tried to self learn the algorithm and in no
        time I was able to solve it myself. My dad promised me to drive to a
        competition in west virginia if i was able to solve it in less than 30
        secs. Today, my personal best is 10.49 secs with a 3x3. I can also
        comfortably solve cubes with one hand and my cubes vary from 2x2 to 7x7,
        Square1, Megaminx, Pyraminx and a Skewb.
