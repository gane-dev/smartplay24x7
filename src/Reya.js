        I am a deep thinker who finds joy in actions rather than words. I am a
        self learner and found a fun calling in Origami and Chess. Learning is
        continuous and teaching what I learnt helps me reassure my
        understanding. Though younger to my brother, i ve always punched higher
        and harder to put up a tuff fight. You are as strong as your opponent.
        My brother and my dad had to hone their skills and re-visit their
        strategies to beat me in Chess.
