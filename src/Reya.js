        I am a contemplative individual who derives satisfaction from actions
        rather than mere words. As a self-learner, I have discovered a
        fulfilling passion for both Origami and Chess. The pursuit of knowledge
        is an ongoing journey for me, and sharing what I have learned serves as
        a means to solidify my own understanding. Despite being younger than my
        brother, I have always risen to the occasion, delivering powerful blows
        in order to put up a formidable fight. I firmly believe that one's
        strength is measured by the challenges faced. Both my brother and my
        father have had to refine their skills and revisit their strategies in
        order to surpass me in the game of Chess.
